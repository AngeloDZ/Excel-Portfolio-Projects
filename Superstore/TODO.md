## To do/think about

### Define the Project Goal (Very Important)

Start with business questions, not charts.

#### Example project objective:

“Analyze Superstore sales data to identify trends in revenue, profitability, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, and provide actionable business insights.”

#### Example questions to answer:

Which regions and states are most/least profitable?

Which product categories drive revenue but hurt profit?

How do discounts affect profit?

Who are the most valuable customers?

Are there seasonal sales trends?

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use Pivot Tables heavily.

#### Sales & Profit Analysis

Total Sales and Profit

Sales & Profit by:

Category

Sub-Category

Region

Segment

#### Trend Analysis

Monthly sales trend

Year-over-year growth

Seasonal patterns

#### Discount Impact

Average profit by discount level

Identify discount thresholds where profit turns negative

### Operational Analysis (Bonus Points)

These are advanced insights for Excel projects:

Average shipping time by region

Profit by ship mode

Late shipments (long shipping times)

High sales but low profit states/products

### Customer Analysis

Create pivots such as:

Top 10 customers by sales

Top 10 customers by profit

Sales by customer segment

Repeat vs one-time customers (if data allows)

Optional:

RFM-style logic (basic version using Excel)
